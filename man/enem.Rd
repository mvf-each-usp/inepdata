\usage{
enem(years, link = NULL, temp.path = ".", keep.download = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{years to get from INEP site; should be a vector of integers}

\item{link}{external http link from where to download.  It is there just in case the
package fails to fetch the correct URL from INEP's site -- which can occur when
INEP alters its site structure, for instance.
(Should you detect this kind of occurrence, please contact this package's author,
just in case he haven't noticed that yet.)}

\item{temp.path}{where should the packed microdata file(s) be downloaded?}

\item{keep.download}{whether to keep or purge the downloaded packed microdata files}

\item{verbose}{do you want know what is going on while this function works?}
}
\value{
A list of lists, indexed by the years present in \code{years} that could be processed.

For each year in \code{years}, either one list is returned in case of success (total or
partial) or \code{NULL} is returned in case of complete lack of success.

In case of success, the item for each year will be a list containing the following
fields:

- \code{data.frame} -- what you are really looking for; it will be here in case of full
    success; it will be either one single data frame or a list of data frames
- \code{last.successfull.step} -- a string; either "download", "unpack", "import",
    "organize" or "format"

Case \code{keep.download == TRUE},

- \code{downloaded.file} path and name of the downloaded packed file
}
