\title{Gets Data from ENEM (Exame Nacional de Ensino MÃ©dio)}
\usage{
enem(years, download.page.url = NULL, temp.path = ".",
  keep.download = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{years to get from INEP site; should be a vector of integers}

\item{download.page.url}{external http link from where to download.
It is there just in case the package fails to fetch the correct URL
from INEP's site -- which can occur when INEP alters its site structure,
for instance.
(Should you detect this kind of occurrence, please contact this package's author,
just in case he haven't noticed that yet.)}

\item{temp.path}{where should the packed microdata file(s) be downloaded?}

\item{keep.download}{whether to keep or purge the downloaded packed microdata files}

\item{verbose}{do you want know what is going on while this function works?}
}
\value{
A list of lists, indexed by the years present in \code{year} that could be processed.

For each year in \code{years}, either one list is returned in case of success (total or
partial) or \code{NULL} is returned in case of complete lack of success.

In case of success, the item for each year will be a list containing the following
fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{last.successful.step} -- a string; either "download", "unpack", "import", "organize" or "format"
\item \code{download.url} -- URL used to download the packed file
\item \code{data.frame} -- what you are really looking for; it will be here in case of full
success; it will be either one single data frame or a list of data frames
}

There might be one or more of the following additional fields in the following
conditions:
\itemize{
\item If \code{keep.download == TRUE} or if \code{last.successful.step == download},
\itemize{
\item \code{downloaded.file} path and name of the downloaded packed file
}
}
}
\description{
Downloads, unpacks, imports, organizes and formats microdata from ENEM editions

\details{
